Drawbacks of the simplified FJ model:
1. Stubbornness is set to 1 uniformly, which cannot reflect real-world scenario, as
    people have different degrees of stubborness. 
2. Z = (I+L)^(-1)s, which means after convergence or in the process, the average/sum
    of opinions equals to the average/sum of innate opinions, which is not true, 'cause
    it means after opinion dynamics, the overall opinoin cannot change.
3. It cannot converge to a polarization state.
4. It does not take the influence of the network structure changes into account.
5. It assumes the weights don't change in the process of opinion dynamics, while the
    weight may change always because of peoples' opinions changes.
6. For echo chamber exclusively, it does not take into account the confirmation bias
    and the social influence, and other factors.
