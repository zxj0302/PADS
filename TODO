6. Collate the code repository
7. NP-H prove, and prove the unbounded below precision of peeling alg

TODO:

1. Add connections alone
2. Reweight alone
3. At the same time

4. Draw the distance-opinion graph

5. Reachability within the same ECC or between different ECCs

1. Results by changing theta
2. Use labels that does not related to polarity
3. The curve of f(S) values under each operation
4. Explain the settings used in diffusion model, Flowless, and PADS


TODO:
1. 准确的最密子图找到的结果，以及时间
2. 带负边的最密子图找到的结果，以及时间
3. 实现算法和Greedy++以及准确的最密子图对比, peeling and gnn convolution combined

Problems:
1. By using opinion dynamics, the polarity variance is decreasing, which may not be the case in real world. I tried FJ
    model, HK model, and other models, but the results are the same. Maybe they are too idealized and cannot reflect the
    real world. In the real world, users post their opinions with different frequencies, and have different influence on
    others, so the opinion dynamics should be more complex(Maybe we can publish a paper for this).
2. If we add edges between users in ECCs, the result is worse than adding edges between high-degree users. So how can we
    find the best way to demonstrate the usefulness of ECCs?
